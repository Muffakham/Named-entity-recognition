# Named-entity-recognition
* Engineered a machine learning based system to detect important words in a text like names, locations, organizations, etc. by using the named entity recognition technique in NLP.
* Trained the machine learning models on the Conll 2003 dataset comprising of 20000 English sentences.
* Performed a comparative study using the f1 score metric between BERT and BERT plus CRF transformer-based machine learning models, which achieved an f1 score of 0.926 and 0.96, respectively.
* Deployed the system as a web application by creating the REST API endpoints using python Flask module.
